A recent report has warned of global food shortages unless the current system of farming and food distribution is changed. The report highlights fears that currently rapid increases in yields come at the expense of sustainability, and that unless action is taken, hunger and malnutrition will become growing problems.
The population is expected to rise to around 8.3 billion in the next twenty years, and urbanisation is set to continue, and it is expected that 65-70% of the worlds population will live in cities. Increasing world prosperity will lead to the rise in demand for energy, food and fresh water.  
The report also considers the billion people worldwide who overeat and are therefore obese to be another example of the failure of the current system to provide health and well-FAIL being to the worlds population. The authors believe that the application of new technologies can play a role in minimising future food shortages. They see cloning, nanotechnology and genetic modification as potential solutions.
However, although many of these technologies have been adopted worldwide, there is still resistance to their use in parts of Europe.
