US publication Rolling Stone magazine is to launch in China. The magazine, which should hit shelves early next year, will focus on China's emerging youth culture as well as foreign arts and entertainment. Rolling Stone was first published in San Francisco in 1967 to chronicle cultural changes in the US. "We feel Chinese music andarts are maturing rapidly and that a Chinese edition will be viable," said Jimmy Jung, of One World Publishing. Rolling Stone has licensed Hong Kong-based One World to publish the Chinese-language edition. Mr Jung said the magazine, to be printed in simplified Chinese characters, will contain a mix of local content written primarily by Beijing-based staff and translations of articles from the US edition. "We want to make sure that we're faithful to the spirit of the brand," said Jung. He added that 
while Hong Kong and Taiwan had more developed pop cultures, mainland China was more important. "We feel China offers greater potential and we want to be there from the 
start," said Jung, whose company also publishes Chinese editions of British car magazine, Top Gear and gadget magazine T3.
