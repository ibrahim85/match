There has been much debate in recent times about when young people should take up a second language. This has been especially fuelled in recent times by the increasing 
importance placed on the English language. It is now commonplace to see parents providing a substantial amount of funds on additional tuition on language lessons to give their children every competitive edge. In the past decade, language institutes have sprung up in numerous urban centres, all claiming to provide rapid advancement in English.
There has been a push by many parents to expose their children to English in their formative years. This, many claim, will make the language more instinctive and ensure that all pronunciation errors can be avoided. There is some evidence which points to youngsters who have been raised in bilingual families, where the language spoken at home is different to the one that they converse with in their external environment. While these children can switch between two languages with greater ease, it remains to be seen whether this is advantageous when learning additional languages.
