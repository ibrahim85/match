    "Readability assessment is a well known problem in natural language processing field. Giving someone the suitable text for his level of comprehension (not so easy and not so hard) could maximize his understanding and enjoyment. In this notebook we are trying to assess the readability of a given text regardless of the text subject using recurrent neural network."
