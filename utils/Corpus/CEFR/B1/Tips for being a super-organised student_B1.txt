Tips for being a super-organised student
posted 2 hours ago by Amy
I have always admired students who hand their homework in on time and never forget to do it. Me, on the other hand, … OK, I admit. I’m terrible at getting myself organised!

But lately I’ve started keeping a small study diary. I write down everything I need to do and when it needs to be done by. Then I write a reminder a few days before the date just in case. It’s helping.

So I was wondering, what are your tips for getting organised? Post a comment below. I’m hoping we can all share some tips to teach us all better study skills.

Good question, Amy. I always spend about five minutes at the end of the day tidying up the desktop on my computer. I make a backup of important documents. I delete things I don’t need any more and put everything into the correct folder.

Nice tip, Hana. I think it’s a good idea to do a little bit of tidying up every day. Then it becomes a habit and your desktop is always organised.

The most important thing is to start studying a few weeks before the exams and not leave it until the night before! That’s just common sense, I think.

Amy
Thanks, Gloria! I agree.

Hi, Amy. My tip is to have a big noticeboard in your bedroom, divided into different sections. I’ve got one. It’s a whiteboard. I’ve got a section for each school subject and another one for other stuff. I use board pens to write reminders and I make sure I look at it every day. The best part is when I remove something from the board!

Great tip, Lou. I’ve got a cork board with pins. I use it in the same way.
